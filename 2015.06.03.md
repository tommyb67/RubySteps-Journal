Hello RubySteps Journal!

I am in what feels like a constant circle of wanting to start over with Ruby and then getting frustrated that I feel like I am starting over!  I believe the answer is repetition.  I need to treat this like the gym.  I have been going to a crossfit gym for the last 6 months.  This type of training is not just physical, there is a lot of mental strain as you try to learn new movements.  It's the same thing with Ruby and Rails.  Learn and repeat as necessary.  A large part of this process is learning how to learn.  Patience is also a large part of the equation.
