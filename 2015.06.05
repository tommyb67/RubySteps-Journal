I did my first 45 minutes yesterday.  I used it to get my development enviornment up to date.  I also posted two items to the discussion board.  Thiese things seem simple.  However, I just need to follow direction and trust the path.  I believe I have skimmed over some of the "easy" things before and I pay for it in the end.  Reinforce the simple until it's committed to memory then move on to the slightly more complicated and repeat the process.
